# Comparative Analysis of Classification Models for Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions

This project examines the performance of different classification models to predict term deposit subscriptions. The dataset used includes 10,000 records from marketing campaigns of a Portuguese bank. The analysis was conducted using **R**, leveraging its robust libraries for statistical modeling and data analysis.

## Methods
Several models were applied, including:
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA/QDA)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Trees and Random Forests**

## Conclusion
Model selection was based on performance metrics such as F1 score, accuracy, and AUC. Random Forest outperformed other models, demonstrating the importance of ensemble methods in achieving more reliable predictions.
