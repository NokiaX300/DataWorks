# Comparative Analysis of Classification Models for Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions

This project evaluates the performance of various classification models to predict whether clients will subscribe to term deposits. The dataset contains 10,000 records from Portuguese bank marketing campaigns, analyzed using **R** for comprehensive data modeling.

## Methods
Several classification models were tested, including:
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA/QDA)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Trees and Random Forests**

## Conclusion
The **Random Forest** model outperformed other methods based on F1 score, accuracy, and AUC, highlighting the effectiveness of ensemble techniques for improving prediction performance.
